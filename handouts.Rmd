# Introduction to Causal Inference

1.  What is the goal of causal inference?

```{asis, include = !params$solutions}
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
```

```{asis}
The goal of causal inference is to estimate the effect of changing one variable (the treatment) on another variable (the outcome). 

Example: In Major League Baseball, should the home team's first batter bunt when the game is tied?

Treatment: Bunt

Outcome: Home Team wins
```

2.  How is causation different from correlation (i.e. an association)?

```{asis, include = !params$solutions}
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\

```

```{asis}
Association is about what we *see*.  Causation is if we *do* something.

Example: In the 2021-22 seasons, the home team came to the plate XX times with the game tied in extra innings.  When the home team bunted (add percent), they went on to win the game YY.  When the home team swung away (add percent), they went on to win the game ZZ.


**Insert table here with basic results.**

This is correlation...it's what we observed.  Not causation because the bunters are fundamentally different from the nonbunters.

# Fundamentals of Causal Inference

Traditional conditional probability notation cannot distinguish between causation and association.

## Assumptions of Causal Inference

* SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption)

```{asis, include = !params$solutions}
\
\
\
\
\
```

```{asis}
The potential outcome for any unit is unaffected by the treatment assignment of other units.
```

* Ignorability

```{asis, include = !params$solutions}
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
```

```{asis}
Treatment assignment is independent of potential outcomes, given a set of observed covariates.
```

* Positivity

```{asis, include = !params$solutions}
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
```


```{asis}
Every unit has a positive probability of receiving each treatment level, ensuring that the causal effect is estimable for all levels of covariates.

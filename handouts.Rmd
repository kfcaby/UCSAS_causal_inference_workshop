# Introduction to Causal Inference

1.  What is the goal of causal inference?


\newpage

2.  How is causation different from correlation (i.e. an association)?

# Fundamentals of Causal Inference

Traditional conditional probability notation cannot distinguish between causation and association. We need to introduce different notation to express causation.

## Assumptions of Causal Inference

* SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption)

```{asis, include = !params$solutions}
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
```

```{asis}
The potential outcome for any unit is unaffected by the treatment assignment of other units.
```

* Ignorability

```{asis, include = !params$solutions}
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
\
```

```{asis}
Treatment assignment is independent of potential outcomes, given a set of observed covariates.
```

* Positivity

\newpage


```{asis}
Every unit has a positive probability of receiving each treatment level, ensuring that the causal effect is estimable for all levels of covariates.
```

# Methods for Causal Inference

## Matching

\newpage

## Propensity Score Matching

\newpage

## Stratification on the Propensity Score

\newpage

## Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting

\newpage

## Covariate Adjustment Using the Propensity Score

### Player effects using location data

Author: Michael Lopez

Title: Building Blocks for Estimating Causal Effects of Athlete Behavior in Football and Hockey Using Player Tracking Data

Where: JSM 2019

Using player location data, we can better estimate player effects by comparing players in similar situations.
